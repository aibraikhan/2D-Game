This is my little home project created to teach the basics of game development. The game is a 2D platformer with exciting levels and cute graphics. In it, the player controls a character who explores different worlds and overcomes obstacles. The main goal of the project is to gain experience in creating games, learn the basics of programming, level design and animation. This is my first attempt to create something of my own, and I hope that it will be a good start on the way to developing more complex and interesting projects in the future.<br>


It's going to get better and better in the future!
